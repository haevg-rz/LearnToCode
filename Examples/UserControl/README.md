# UserControl

This example solution covers the usage of `UserControl`s.  

> Controls in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) support rich content, styles, triggers, and templates. In many cases, these features allow you to create custom and consistent experiences without having to create a new control. For more information, see [Styling and Templating](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop-wpf/fundamentals/styles-templates-overview?view=netframework-4.8).
> If you do need to create a new control, the simplest way is to create a class that derives from **UserControl**.

For more Information go to [UserControl Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.controls.usercontrol?view=netframework-4.8).
